# Form Validation Project

This is a simple and responsive form with real-time validation built using HTML, TailwindCSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It validates user input for various fields (e.g., name, email, password) and provides clear feedback messages for errors.

## Features

- Real-time input validation
- Error messages displayed under each field
- Validation for:
  - Required fields
  - Valid email format
  - Password strength 
- Responsive design with TailwindCSS

Folder Structure

├── index.html         # Form layout

└── script.js          # Validation logic

How It Works
.When a user types into a form field, JavaScript checks the input.
. If the input is invalid, an error message is shown and the input is highlighted.
. On valid input, the error is cleared and the input is marked as valid.
. Form submission is only allowed if all fields pass validation.
